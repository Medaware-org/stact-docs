\xsection{Our Solution}
In light of the current situation, we chose to develop an educational platform designed to make the public aware of said
risks and dangers, whilst providing useful information regarding the treatment of accidentally ingesting, or otherwise
causing a hazardous scenario.
Recognising our inadequate medicial qualifications during development, we expanded the project past our initial scope,
by creating a generic self-hosted solution which can be maintained by a public health entity or organisation and operated
as a public medical ``Knowledge Base''.
