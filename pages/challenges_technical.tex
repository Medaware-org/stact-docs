\xsection{Technical Difficulties}
During the development of the \textit{Medaware} Suite, we identified numerous technical challenges. Fortunately, due to
our exceptional team, they were particularly easy to overcome.
One such challenge was the lack of an easily-integrable \textit{WYSIWYG} editor for the creation and maintenance of
articles on our platform. We worked around this issue by developing a custom solution, \textit{Tangential}, which is far more
integrated into our system than what any pre-made package could ever allow.
Another issue that ended up in the expansion of our technological stack was the issue of reliance on third-parties for image
data; Our editor system, as well as the subsequent rendering pipeline, relies on external providers for fetching images
for use in the articles on our platform. To avoid potential issues caused by possible down-time, we elected to cache said
data in a \textit{MinIO} instance, which runs on the same server as the \textit{Catalyst} backend.
