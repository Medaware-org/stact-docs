\xsection{The Challenge}
The motivation behind the \textit{Medaware} proejct was the less-than-optimal knowledge of basic medicine
among the general public. We recognised that most people were unaware of the potential risks of numerous household
items and chemicals, let alone the proper treatment and damage control measures in the case of
inadvertent ingestion. Furthermore, we recognised the possible side-effects of various over-the-counter medicines
that could lead to unexpected side-effects if used improperly; many are unaware of the serious, life-threatening
consequences of combining \textit{ethanol} and \textit{acetaminophen}, for example.
